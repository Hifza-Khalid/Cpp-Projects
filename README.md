# 🚀 C++ Project Collection

Welcome to this collection of C++ projects! This repository contains multiple C++ programs designed to handle different real-world scenarios, including finance management, hostel accommodation, car rental, and student management. Each program is built using fundamental programming concepts such as file handling, loops, conditional statements, and functions.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Finance Management System
Manage your income and expenses efficiently with this simple finance tracker.
- 💰 Add Income
- 💸 Add Expenses
- 📊 Check Balance (Profit/Loss)
- 🔄 Persistent tracking using file handling

📂 **File:** [`finance_management.cpp`](https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/Cpp-Projects/blob/main/finance_management.cpp)

---

### 2️⃣ Hostel Accommodation System
An interactive system to manage hostel bed reservations.
- 🏨 Hostel details (rent, availability)
- 🛏️ Bed reservation system
- 📝 Student details storage
- 📂 File handling for hostel and student records

📂 **File:** [`hostel_accommodation.cpp`](https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/Cpp-Projects/blob/main/hostel_accommodation.cpp)

---

### 3️⃣ Car Rental System
A simple car rental service where users can rent and return cars.
- 🚗 Display available cars
- 🏷️ Rent a car for a specific number of days
- 🔄 Return a rented car
- 💵 Calculate rental cost

📂 **File:** [`rent_a_ride.cpp`](https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/Cpp-Projects/blob/main/rent_a_ride.cpp)

---

### 4️⃣ Student Management System
A basic student database system that allows storing and retrieving student information.
- 📝 Add student details (Name, Roll No, CGPA)
- 📄 Store data in a file for future reference
- 🔍 Retrieve and display student information

📂 **File:** [`student_management.cpp`](https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/Cpp-Projects/blob/main/student_management.cpp)

## 🛠 Requirements
To compile and run these programs, ensure you have:
- A **C++ compiler** (e.g., **g++**, **MinGW**, **MSVC**)
- A **code editor** (e.g., **Visual Studio Code**, **Dev-C++**, **Code::Blocks**)
- **Windows OS** (for `windows.h` dependencies) or modify the code for cross-platform compatibility

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/Cpp-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Cpp-Projects
   ```
3. # Compile and run Finance Management System
g++ -o finance_management finance_management.cpp
./finance_management

# Compile and run Hostel Accommodation System
g++ -o hostel_accommodation hostel_accommodation.cpp
./hostel_accommodation

# Compile and run Car Rental System
g++ -o rent_a_ride rent_a_ride.cpp
./rent_a_ride

# Compile and run Student Management System
g++ -o student_management student_management.cpp
./student_management

## 📌 Notes
- Some programs use **file handling** (`fstream`) to store data permanently.
- The **car rental system** and **hostel system** store data in text files.
- **Windows-only commands** like `system("cls")` can be removed for Linux/macOS.
